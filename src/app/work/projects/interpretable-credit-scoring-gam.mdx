## Overview

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/JazzzFM/InterpretableRankingWithGeneralizedAdditiveModels)

This project delivers a complete enterprise MLOps system for credit scoring. It leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to provide high-accuracy predictions while maintaining full interpretability—a critical requirement for regulatory compliance in the financial sector.

## Key Features

- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Uses GAMs (via InterpretML) to generate feature contribution graphs, allowing loan officers to understand exactly *why* a score was assigned.
- **Automatic Ranking**: Implements learning-to-rank algorithms to prioritize high-value applicants.
- **End-to-End MLOps**: Includes automated retraining pipelines, drift detection, and model serving via FastAPI.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designed to meet "Right to Explanation" standards (GDPR/CCPA/local financial laws).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language.
- **InterpretML / EBM**: For interpretable machine learning models.
- **FastAPI**: High-performance model serving.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Scalable deployment.
- **PostgreSQL**: Feature store and transaction logging.

## Outcome

The system bridges the gap between black-box AI performance and the transparency required by financial institutions, enabling safer and more fair credit lending decisions.
