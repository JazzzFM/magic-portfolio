## Overview

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/JazzzFM/AegisFraud)

AegisFraud (from Greek “aegis” = shield) is a high-performance, real-time fraud detection platform. It ingests transaction streams to detect anomalies in milliseconds, preventing financial loss before it happens.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes Apache Kafka and Flink for sub-second event processing and feature extraction.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines batch training (Airflow) with real-time inference (Flink/On-line serving).
- **Dynamic Rules Engine**: Allows analysts to update fraud detection rules on the fly without redeploying the entire system.
- **Model Lifecycle**: Managed via MLflow for versioning, staging, and promoting detection models.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming backbone.
- **Apache Flink**: Stateful stream processing.
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestration of batch retraining pipelines.
- **MLflow**: Model registry and tracking.
- **Python & Java**: For model development and Flink jobs.

## Outcome

AegisFraud demonstrates how modern streaming technologies can be composed to solve critical security challenges, providing a scalable shield against evolving fraud patterns.
