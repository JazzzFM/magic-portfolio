## Overview

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/JazzzFM/SentinelMCP)

SentinelMCP is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for enterprise complexity. It goes beyond simple Q&A by orchestrating multiple AI agents to perform tasks and integrating with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to safely expose institutional tools (like databases, APIs, and document stores) to LLMs.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinates specialized agents (e.g., "Researcher," "Coder," "Reviewer") to solve complex multi-step problems.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Implements standard interfaces for connecting LLMs to internal data sources and tools securely.
- **Advanced RAG**: Features hybrid search (semantic + keyword), reranking, and document parsing for high-precision retrieval.
- **Production Grade**: Built with observability, tracing (LangSmith/Phoenix), and rate-limiting in mind.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic.
- **LangChain / LangGraph**: Agent orchestration framework.
- **Vector Database**: (e.g., Pinecone/Qdrant) for semantic search.
- **LLMs**: Integration with OpenAI/Anthropic/Local LLMs.
- **MCP**: For standardized tool interfaces.

## Outcome

SentinelMCP paves the way for "Agentic AI" in the enterprise, allowing organizations to automate complex knowledge workflows securely and reliably.
