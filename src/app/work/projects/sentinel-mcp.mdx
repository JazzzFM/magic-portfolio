## Overview

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/JazzzFM/SentinelMCP)

SentinelMCP bridges the gap between static RAG systems and autonomous agents. It leverages **AutoGen (Core & Studio)** for sophisticated multi-agent conversations and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to provide agents with real-world capabilities like web browsing and specialized data analysis.

## The Challenge

Traditional RAG systems are often "read-only" and struggle with multi-step reasoning. I needed a system that could:
1.  **Orchestrate autonomous conversations**: Enable multiple agents to deliberate, peer-review, and execute code.
2.  **Standardize Tool Access**: Use MCP to connect to specialized servers without custom boilerplate.
3.  **Execute Real-world Actions**: Move beyond text to perform web research and analyze dynamic data.

## Solution Architecture

The system is built on an event-driven agentic architecture:

-   **Agent Orchestration (AutoGen Core)**: Manages a conversation-based workflow where agents (e.g., "Commander," "Researcher," "Analyst") exchange messages to solve problems.
-   **AutoGen Studio UI**: Provides a high-level interface for rapid prototyping and visualization of agent interactions and session histories.
-   **MCP Integration**:
    -   **Playwright MCP**: Empowers agents to browse the web, handle JavaScript-heavy sites, and extract real-time data.
    -   **Tidewave MCP**: Enables specialized data analysis and institutional tool connectivity.
-   **Observability**: Integrated tracing to monitor agent deliberations and tool call accuracy.

## Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Multi-Agent Conversations with AutoGen
Unlike rigid directed graphs, AutoGen allows for flexible, conversation-based problem-solving. I implemented a **GroupChat** manager that dynamically decides which agent should speak next based on the task state.
-   **Commander**: Breaks down user intent into a backlog.
-   **Web Researcher**: Uses the Playwright MCP server to fetch live data.
-   **Critic**: Validates the researcher's output before the final answer is delivered.

### 2. Why Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
By adopting MCP, SentinelMCP decouples tool implementation from agent logic. Using the **Playwright MCP server** allows agents to perform autonomous web browsing through a standardized protocol, making the system modular and easy to extend with new MCP servers like Tidewave for specific data domains.

### 3. Production Readiness
-   **State Management**: Leveraged AutoGen's persistent session storage for long-running agentic workflows.
-   **Security**: All code execution (via AutoGen's code executors) is sandboxed to prevent unauthorized system access.

## Technologies Used

-   **Python 3.11+**: Core implementation.
-   **AutoGen (Core & Studio)**: Agent orchestration and UI.
-   **Playwright MCP**: Autonomous web browsing.
-   **Tidewave MCP**: Specialized data analysis tools.
-   **Docker**: Sandboxed execution environment.

## Outcome

SentinelMCP demonstrates a modular approach to "Agentic AI". By combining AutoGen's conversational power with the standardized connectivity of MCP, it creates a robust framework for automating complex, real-world knowledge tasks.
