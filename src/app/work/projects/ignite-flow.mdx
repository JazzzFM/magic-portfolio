## Overview

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/JazzzFM/IgniteFlow)

IgniteFlow is a production-ready template designed to accelerate the deployment of cloud-native Spark ETL and Machine Learning pipelines. It adopts a container-first approach, leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and focuses on pragmatic, scalable solutions for modern data engineering challenges.

## Key Features

- **Container-First Architecture**: Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments by containerizing Spark jobs and dependencies.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: fully automates infrastructure provisioning using Terraform/OpenTofu, enabling reproducible and version-controlled environments.
- **Scalable ETL Pipelines**: Optimized for high-throughput data processing using Apache Spark, capable of handling terabyte-scale datasets.
- **MLOps Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing engine.
- **Docker**: Containerization for reproducibility.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning on AWS.
- **Python**: Primary language for ETL logic and ML modeling.
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

## Outcome

IgniteFlow serves as a foundational accelerator for data teams, reducing the time-to-production for complex data pipelines from weeks to days while enforcing best practices in reliability and observability.
