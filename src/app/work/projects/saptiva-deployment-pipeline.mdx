## Overview

At Saptiva AI, I led the deployment of mission-critical AI systems for high-stakes sectors, including banking, defense, and government across Latin America. The core challenge was delivering cutting-edge AI within highly regulated environments that require strict security, auditability, and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Delivery**: Built a unified deployment framework using Docker and CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency across diverse client environments.
- **Regulated Environment Compliance**: Implemented security-first runbooks and deployment strategies tailored for air-gapped or restricted networks.
- **Latency Optimization**: Fine-tuned model serving layers to meet the demanding SLAs of financial institutions.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Integrated production-grade logging and alerting to proactively identify drift and system health issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker & Kubernetes**: For scalable and portable container orchestration.
- **GitLab CI/CD / GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment.
- **FastAPI / Go**: For high-performance model serving APIs.
- **Python**: Core language for model integration and orchestration scripts.

## Outcome

The standardized pipeline reduced the "Prototype to Production" time by 40%, enabling faster delivery of value to clients while maintaining the rigorous security standards required by national defense and central banking entities.
